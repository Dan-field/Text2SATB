My work on the Textual Data Sonification and Algorithmic Composition Competition

Check out https://www.scienceweek.net.au/textual-data-sonification-and-algorithmic-composition-competition/ or http://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e06876/nsw/ for info about the competition.

Even though I'm making this publicly available with a permissive licence, I think it goes without saying that anybody entering the competition should do their own work.
